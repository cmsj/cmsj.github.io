So this is a fun one, some marvellous hackers, including Zoltan Balaton and Sebastien Mauer have been working Qemu to add support for the [Sam460ex motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam460ex), a PowerPC system from 2010. Of particular interest to me is that this was a board which received an official port of Amiga OS 4, the spiritual successor to AmigaOS, one of my very favourite operating systems.

I'll probably write more about this later, but for now, here is a simple screenshot of the install CD having just booted.
