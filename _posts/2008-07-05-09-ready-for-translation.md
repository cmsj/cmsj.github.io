The list of milestone bugs is now clear of items which affect the UI, so we are now in string freeze. I uploaded a new POT for 0.9 so the wonderful, wonderful community of translators can weave their magic. We did have a small false start which required changing one string, but unless anyone shakes out any new bugs, that's it. 0.9 is one step closer to release.
