# The good news

You've made it to my site!

# The bad news

This blog has moved from Blogger to GitHub and all the URLs have changed. Sorry!

# The good news again

If you're looking for Terminator, I'm sorry to say that I haven't maintained the project since 2013, so you're going to need to head over to its Launchpad page to talk to the lovely folk who maintain it now - see [https://launchpad.net/terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator).

If you're looking for a URL like ```/2004/10/28/foo-bar-baz.html``` just switch it to ```/2004-10-28-foo-bar-baz.html``` and it'll probably work.

If you're looking for something else, I don't know what to say, I probably don't have it online anymore, may I suggest asking the lovely folk at The Internet Archive? They should have a pretty complete history of this site at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.tenshu.net">https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.tenshu.net</a>.

Thanks for coming, sorry this wasn't more immediately useful.
