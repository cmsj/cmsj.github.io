# The good news

You've made it to my site!

# The bad news

This blog has moved through several iterations of hosting, most recently it's a jekyll powered site hosted by GitHub.

Previously it was on Blogger.

All of that is boring, but it means that URLs have inevitably changed, and here you are at the 404 page. Sorry!

# The good news again

I can at least vaguely help to guide you towards my content, right?

If you're looking for a URL like ```/2004/10/28/foo-bar-baz.html``` just switch it to ```/2004-10-28-foo-bar-baz.html``` and it'll probably work.

If you're looking for Terminator, I'm sorry to say that I haven't maintained the project since 2013, so you're going to need to head over to its Launchpad page to talk to the lovely folk who maintain it now - see [https://launchpad.net/terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator).

If you're looking for something else, I don't know what to say, I probably don't have it online anymore, may I suggest asking the lovely folk at The Internet Archive? They should have a pretty complete history of this site at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.tenshu.net">https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.tenshu.net</a>.

Thanks for coming, sorry this wasn't more immediately useful.
